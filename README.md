# ConwayEngine
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++

Fun attempt to make a semi interactive version of Conway's game of life.

Uses SFML to display the simulation.

## Current State
- Offers basic controls for pausing and adjusting the speed. Currently just displays common Conway patterns to check it is all working
- Written in Visual Studio

## Future Development
- Add more generation functions
- More simulation controls
- Better SFML implementation/graphical support
- Move conway specific stuff into its own library
- Optimise the simulation (storage of data, parallelism, etc)

## Reading
You can read the blog posts I have made about this as I have been developing it at my blog site [constreference](https://constreference.wordpress.com)
